Below is the summary of what I'm learning everyday and the link to fork the project in Repl.it(Online IDE)

Also u would find an emoji welcoming u daily because I just added those to have some fun !!!( kind of extra stuff )

DAY 1:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-1-Band-Name-Generator):

A Band Name Gernerator from the input of the user by their country name and pet name
1) Used input,print functions and then created a variable
2) More about commenting(combining using +, indentation are really important) 
3) Learned that \n commenting brings the content/cursor to the next line in a single print function

DAY 2:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-02-Tip-Calculator):
 
 A simple Calculator was created taking the inputs of the totalbill, the percentage of the tips to be given and the number of people to split the bill
 
 1)Usage of underscore_ for largenumbers was insightful and it treats like a normal integer\
 2)Applied the f string,type conversion , data type matching (else we can't concatenate) , type error and type checking\
 3)Learnt the PEMDAS rule updated as PEMDASLR (with same priorities executed from left to right) and learnt about the round off e.g:round(2.666,2) to 2.67
