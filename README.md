# 100-days-of-code-in-python
The Complete Python PRO Bootcamp by Angela Yu's course with 100 projects with classes for 2 hours each day.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository will store all the related projects. If you are interested in any code files, please run the code in an IDE for python, although running it in replit as some modules are imported based on the website.

Below is the summary of what I'm learning everyday and the link to fork the project in Repl.it(Online IDE)

If interested kindly pls head to those link and try running it !! 

Also u would find an emoji welcoming u daily because I just added those to have some fun !!!( kind of extra stuff )

**DAY 1:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-1-Band-Name-Generator):**

**A Band Name Gernerator** from the input of the user by their country name and pet name
1) Used input,print functions and then created a variable
2) More about commenting(combining using +, indentation are really important)
3) Learned that \n commenting brings the content/cursor to the next line in a single print function

**DAY 2:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-02-Tip-Calculator):**
 
**A simple Calculator** was created taking the inputs of the totalbill, the percentage of the tips to be given and the number of people to split the bill
 
1) Usage of underscore_ for largenumbers was insightful and it treats like a normal integer\
2) Applied the f string,type conversion , data type matching (else we can't concatenate) , type error and type checking<br/>
3) Learnt the PEMDAS rule updated as PEMDASLR (with same priorities executed from left to right) and learnt about the round off e.g:round(2.666,2) to 2.67

 **DAY 3:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-03-Treasure-Island):**
 
Created a **Beautiful Treasure Island** that responds  the way u give the input and gives u different outcomes.
 
1) Introduced to the conditional statements : if and else statement, Nested if statements and elif statements ,if/elif/else statements\
2) More about indentation and it's importance\
3) Comparison Operators <,>,<=,>=,==,!= and = is an Assignment operator that has right associativity\
4) Developed a love calculator and it was fun !!!( A pseudo science)
  Just enter ur name and ur crush or ur lover name and find how it works ..Best wishes !!(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-day-3-5-lovecalculator)
5) How to accept any kind of inputs if in lower or in upper case

 **DAY 4:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-04-Rock-Paper-Scissors)**
 
 Created the nostalgic Childhood game **Rock-Paper-Scissor by using random module** and thus making the computer to generate the random moves and then the game begins.
 
1) Introduced to Random module and differentiating between random.random(always produces the output as 0.000-0.9999 in float),random.randomint(starting index, ending         index),random.float()/random.choice(list_name)\
2) Also created my own module\
3) Introduced to DATA STRUCTURE - Lists ( to replace, append, extend, indexing as '0' to access from the beginning or '-1' to access from the last in the list)\
4) Nested List- and this can be accessed using the proper indexing (e.g:list_names[1][2] which means accessing the second list's second list element)\
5) Worked with index error if the range exceeds which has to be reduced while indicating the range( actual length should be subtracted from 1 to get the correct range)

**DAY 5:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-05-Password-Generator)**

Created the **Password Generator** which has 2 levels in it:<\br>
**1) The Easy one:** which gets the input count of letters,symbols and numbers and gives the output<\br>
**2) The Hard one:** here it shuffles the letters, symbols and numbers and then creates the sequence of password which is really hard to hack as it creates a different <\br>                             passwords with different sequence each time adding an extra level of security.
1) Learned the fundamentals of for loops and for loop with a range for x in range(start, end, [step/gap])<\br>
2) shuffle strings with the random.shuffle thus, shuffled a list!<\br>
3) Learned the way to convert a list into a string <\br>
4) Learned the logic behind for loops  wiht mentioning range or directly accessing in list.
