DAY 1:(https://replit.com/@PC10/PandiChitra-Day-1-Band-Name-Generator):

A Band Name Gernerator from the input of the user by their country name and pet name
1) Used input,print functions and then created a variable
2) More about commenting(combining using +, indentation are really important) 
3) Learned that \n commenting brings the content/cursor to the next line in a single print function
